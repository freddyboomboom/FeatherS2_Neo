# FeatherS2_Neo

This repo will contain files I create for use with the Unexpected Maker FeatherS2 Neo, which is a Feather format microcontroller board with an Espressif ESP32-S2 microcontroller.

You can find out more about them, and purchase one youself, from here: https://unexpectedmaker.com/feathers2-neo

neomatrix_text.py is used to test all the NeoPixels in the 5x5 matrix, and is written for use with CircuitPython. It is based on a MicroPython script from Andy Piper: https://github.com/andypiper/fivebyfive/blob/main/micropython/main.py
